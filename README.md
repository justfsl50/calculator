## Features

- **Addition**: Allows you to add two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Lets you subtract one number from another.
- **Multiplication**: Enables you to multiply two numbers.
- **Division**: Performs division between two numbers.
- **Square Root**: Calculates the square root of a given number.
- **Exponentiation**: Computes the result of raising a number to a power.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this calculator, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- **Python**: You must have Python 3.x installed. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

No additional libraries are required as the calculator uses the built-in `math` library.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-calculator.git

## Navigate to the project directory:
bash-
cd python-calculator

## Run the calculator:
python calculator.py

## How It's Built

The calculator is built using Python and relies on the built-in math library for square root and exponentiation operations. Here's an overview of the code structure:

The main calculator logic is contained in calculator.py.
The program uses a while loop to continuously prompt the user for input and perform calculations until the user chooses to exit.
if-elif statements are used to determine which operation to perform based on the user's choice.
The math library is imported to perform square root and exponentiation operations.
